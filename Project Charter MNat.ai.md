| **Project Purpose / Business Justification** *Describe the business need this project addresses* |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The purpose of the application is to provide individuals in high-risk natural disaster areas with personalized emergency escape plans and real-time resources to enhance their safety and preparedness. The app will offer customized evacuation routes, supply checklists, and local shelter information, along with a chatbot that can answer disaster-related questions in real-time.  The app addresses a critical need for personalized emergency preparedness, as natural disasters are becoming more frequent and severe. The growing focus on disaster resilience creates market opportunities, with potential revenue streams from premium subscriptions, affiliate partnerships with retailers, and collaborations with emergency retailers. With the application integrating GIS mapping, real-time weather data, and supply recommendations, it offers unique, tech-driven solutions that enhance emergency readiness and response. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Objectives (in business terms)** *Describe the measurable outcomes of the project, e.g., reduce cost by xxxx or increase quality to yyyy* |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Provide personalized emergency escape plans for users within the first year. Reduce time spent on emergency planning by 50%. Deliver real-time evacuation alerts, shelter locations, and supply checklists. Partner with major retailers such as Walmart, Lowes, Home Depot, and Amazon to integrate emergency supply purchasing.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Deliverables** *List the high-level “products” to be created (e.g., improved xxxx process, employee manual on yyyy)* |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Project Team meetings will be held once a week, typically after 5 pm, depending on who can attend the meetings but 3/4 members must attend to maintain proper communication to avoid confusion amongst the Team and Stakeholder(s). Status reports will be a mix of Team minutes and/or notes that the stakeholder(s) may have.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
